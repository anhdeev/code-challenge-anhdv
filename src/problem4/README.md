1. Overview

The module is responsible for securely managing real-time updates to a scoreboard that displays the top 10 users based on their scores. The API will validate requests, update scores, and push real-time updates to connected clients. The solution incorporates:
	•	Kong Gateway for API management.
	•	AWS Secrets Manager for secure storage of sensitive data.
	•	OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication.
	•	Rate Limiting to prevent abuse.

2. Functional Requirements
	1.	Live Scoreboard Updates:
	•	Clients should receive real-time updates when the leaderboard changes.
	•	The top 10 scores should be dynamically fetched.
	2.	Score Update API:
	•	Users should be able to increment their scores through secure API requests.
	•	Each score update must be authenticated and authorized.
	3.	Security:
	•	Protect against unauthorized updates.
	•	Prevent malicious or excessive API usage with rate limiting.
	4.	Scalability:
	•	Handle large volumes of concurrent requests without impacting performance.
	•	Ensure durability of score updates.

3. Architecture Overview

Key Components:
	•	API Gateway (Kong):
	•	Handles API requests.
	•	Enforces rate limiting, OAuth 2.0, and traffic control.
	•	Redis:
	•	Acts as a high-performance in-memory cache for real-time scores.
	•	Manages leaderboard updates using sorted sets.
	•	Database (PostgreSQL):
	•	Stores persistent user and score data.
	•	Periodic updates from Redis ensure data durability.
	•	AWS Secrets Manager:
	•	Manages sensitive credentials (e.g., database credentials, OAuth keys).
	•	WebSockets:
	•	Provides real-time updates to clients when leaderboard changes.
	•	Background Workers:
	•	Process batched updates from Redis to the database.

4. API Design

Endpoints

1. Update Score
	•	POST /api/scores/update
	•	Description: Updates the user’s score after an action.
	•	Request Payload:

{
  "userId": "string",
  "actionId": "string"
}


	•	Response:

{
  "success": true,
  "newScore": 150
}


	•	Rate Limit: 10 requests per minute per user.

2. Get Leaderboard
	•	GET /api/scores/leaderboard
	•	Description: Retrieves the top 10 scores.
	•	Response:

{
  "leaderboard": [
    { "rank": 1, "userId": "u123", "score": 1200 },
    { "rank": 2, "userId": "u124", "score": 1100 }
  ]
}



3. Real-Time Leaderboard Updates
	•	WebSocket /ws/scoreboard
	•	Description: Streams live leaderboard updates to connected clients.

5. Authentication and Authorization
	1.	OAuth 2.0 via Kong Gateway:
	•	Use OAuth 2.0 for user authentication and access control.
	•	Tokens are validated by Kong before forwarding requests to the API.
	2.	Scope Management:
	•	Define scopes for actions (e.g., update:score, read:leaderboard).
	•	Only authorized users can increment scores.

6. Rate Limiting
	•	Rate Limiting via Kong Gateway:
	•	Limit to 10 requests per minute per user for the POST /api/scores/update endpoint.
	•	Enforced at the gateway layer to minimize load on the application server.

7. Security Considerations
	1.	AWS Secrets Manager:
	•	Store sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, Redis keys, OAuth secrets).
	•	Rotate secrets periodically to reduce exposure risks.
	2.	JWT Validation:
	•	Ensure all incoming requests include a valid JWT with a signature verified against the OAuth provider.
	3.	Input Validation:
	•	Sanitize and validate all inputs (e.g., userId, actionId) to prevent injection attacks.
	4.	Redis Persistence:
	•	Enable Redis append-only file (AOF) for durability.

8. Infrastructure Components
	1.	Kong Gateway:
	•	API gateway for request validation, rate limiting, and traffic management.
	2.	Redis:
	•	Real-time cache and leaderboard manager.
	3.	AWS Secrets Manager:
	•	Secure storage for sensitive configurations.
	4.	Database (PostgreSQL):
	•	Durable storage for user and score data.
	5.	WebSocket Server:
	•	Real-time communication with clients.

9. Flow of Execution
	1.	Score Update Flow:
	•	User action triggers a POST /api/scores/update request.
	•	Kong validates the OAuth token and rate limits the request.
	•	The API increments the score in Redis and logs the update to a persistent queue.
	•	Redis manages leaderboard updates.
	•	Background workers flush updates to the database periodically.
	2.	Leaderboard Retrieval:
	•	Client fetches the leaderboard from the GET /api/scores/leaderboard endpoint or subscribes to real-time updates via WebSocket.

10. Database Design

Tables

Users

Column	Type	Description
id	UUID	Primary key
name	VARCHAR	User name
email	VARCHAR	User email

Scores

Column	Type	Description
userId	UUID	Foreign key to Users
score	INT	User’s total score

11. Implementation Notes
	•	Use Redis Sorted Sets (ZADD) for real-time leaderboard updates.
	•	Enable Redis AOF for durability.
	•	Implement background workers for batch database writes.

12. Additional Enhancements
	1.	Monitoring and Metrics:
	•	Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor API usage and system health.
	2.	Scaling:
	•	Deploy the system using Kubernetes for auto-scaling capabilities.
	3.	Logging and Auditing:
	•	Use ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging and debugging.
